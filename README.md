## Who am I ?

<p>I have been working in relationship marketing for 4 years and more specifically in the small world of e-mailing. Both exciting and complex, it is possible to do interesting things as soon as you follow a coherent strategy.

In 2023, I went with my partner to Australia and New Zealand for 10 months. We worked on a strawberries farm and learned so many things from the locals.</p>

In 2024 I decided to complete my skills as an email developer by becoming a web developer.

## My latests projects
I wanted to challenge myself on a solo project during my holidays : 
- Estimated time : (40-hours)
- Main Technos : React / Scss
